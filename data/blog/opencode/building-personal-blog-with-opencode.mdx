# Building a Personal Blog with OpenCode

In this post, I'll document our entire process of building a personal blog from scratch using OpenCode, the AI-powered development assistant. This comprehensive guide covers everything from initial planning to final implementation.

## The Planning Process

### Step 1: Defining the Project Scope

We started by creating a structured plan using OpenCode's todo management system. The initial plan included 10 key tasks:

```markdown
1. Choose technology stack and framework for the blog (High Priority)
2. Set up project structure and basic configuration (High Priority)
3. Create basic layout and navigation components (Medium Priority)
4. Implement blog post listing and detail pages (Medium Priority)
5. Add content management (create/edit/delete posts) (Medium Priority)
6. Style the blog with CSS/styling framework (Medium Priority)
7. Add responsive design for mobile devices (Low Priority)
8. Implement search and filtering functionality (Low Priority)
9. Add comments and social sharing features (Low Priority)
10. Deploy the blog to a hosting platform (Low Priority)
```

### Step 2: Technology Stack Selection

OpenCode presented us with several technology stack options:

- **Next.js (React)** - Modern React framework with great SEO and performance ✅
- **Gatsby (React)** - Static site generator optimized for blogs
- **Hugo (Go)** - Fast static site generator with templates
- **Jekyll (Ruby)** - GitHub Pages native static site generator
- **Plain HTML/CSS/JS** - Simple and lightweight approach

We chose **Next.js** for its excellent SEO benefits, performance optimizations, and modern React ecosystem.

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Project Setup

OpenCode helped us initialize the project with:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest personal-blog --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

This single command set up:

- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- App Router structure
- Proper import aliases

### Phase 2: Core Components

We created three essential components:

#### Header Component

```typescript
// src/components/Header.tsx
export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="w-full border-b border-gray-200 bg-white dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-900">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-4xl px-4 py-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            My Blog
          </h1>
          <nav className="flex space-x-6">
            {/* Navigation links */}
          </nav>
        </div>
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}
```

#### Layout Component

```typescript
// src/components/Layout.tsx
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">
      <Header />
      <main className="flex-grow">
        {children}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Footer Component

Similar structure with social links and copyright information.

### Phase 3: Content Management Strategy

When it came to content management, OpenCode offered several approaches:

1. **File-based (Markdown)** - Store posts as Markdown files ✅
2. **Database with Admin Panel** - Custom admin interface
3. **Headless CMS Integration** - External CMS services
4. **Static JSON Files** - Manage JSON data directly

We chose **File-based Markdown** for its simplicity, version control benefits, and static site generation capabilities.

### Phase 4: Markdown Processing System

OpenCode helped us implement a robust Markdown processing system:

```typescript
// src/lib/posts.ts
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import { remark } from 'remark'
import remarkHtml from 'remark-html'

export function getPostBySlug(slug: string, includeContent = true): Post | undefined {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)

  // Process Markdown to HTML
  const processedMarkdown = remark().use(remarkHtml).processSync(content)

  return {
    slug,
    title: data.title,
    content: processedMarkdown.toString(),
    // ... other metadata
  }
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Routing

- `/` - Home page with recent posts
- `/posts` - All posts listing
- `/posts/[slug]` - Individual post pages
- `/about` - About page

### 2. Content Structure

```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── getting-started-with-nextjs.md
│   ├── tailwind-css-best-practices.md
│   └── typescript-for-react-developers.md
└── authors.json
```

### 3. Markdown Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: 'Post Title'
author: 'author-id'
publishedAt: '2024-01-25'
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
excerpt: 'Brief description...'
---
```

### 4. Author Management

Centralized author information in JSON format with support for:

- Name and bio
- Social media links
- Avatar images

  const slugs = getAllPostSlugs()
  return slugs.map((slug) => ({ slug }))
}
```

### Code Splitting

Automatic code splitting ensures optimal loading times.

### Image Optimization

Next.js Image component for optimized image delivery.

## Future Enhancements
