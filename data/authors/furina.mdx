Furina de Fontaine is the Hydro Archon and ruler of Fontaine, known for her flamboyant personality and celebrity status among her people. Despite being viewed as a god by many, she is more cherished as a celebrated performer who often graces the stage at Fontaine's renowned opera house.

Born from the separation of the true Hydro Archon Focalors, Furina possesses no divine powers but carries the curse of immortality, having lived for over five hundred years. For centuries, she was forced to maintain the facade of being Fontaine's ruler while secretly enduring isolation and suppressing her inner thoughts to protect her nation from a devastating prophecy.

Her distinctive design features heterochromatic eyes, streaked hair representing dual aspects of her personality, and an elegant ensemble blending French aristocratic elements with playful touches. As a performer, she is known for singing "La vaguelette," a French-inspired song that reflects the themes of her story journey.

Following the events that freed her from her divine curse, Furina now embraces her humanity and continues to captivate audiences with her theatrical performances. She stands as a testament to mental fortitude and sacrifice, proving that true strength lies not in divine power but in the resilience of the human spirit.
